# Twitter-Filter
INSPIRATION

Creation of a Machine Learning Model with the use of Naive Bayes Algorithm to classify tweets of two leaders.

DETAILS

The model implements Natural Language Processing technique and the use of Naive Bayes Probabilistic Approach. The provided dataset consists of tweets as the predictor variable and the names of two leaders as the target variable. The classifier model predicts the leader's name based on the tweet provided to the model. Model has been trained on Jupyter Notebook Environment with use of Python Language.
